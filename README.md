AI project

This project allows us to develop educational tools to both teach and assess students on aspects of AI. 
So far we have uploaded prototypes to show our intial design views for these tools, which include: a basic GUI to show how algorithmic searches will be displayed, a basic GUI to show how interactive tools for belief networks will be displayed and a website which students have to be granted access to by an assessor to answer online questions.
All three protoypes were developed in Python, where the website was developed using the Django framework library and the GUIs were developed using the tkinter library.
